The data that support the findings of this article are  openly available here.
Files ending with .in and .bat are used for GPT simulations. The .m files are for MATLAB data processing. There are also some .txt files that contain 6D particle coordinates exported from OSIRIS. The remaining files are input files for the PIC simulation software OSIRIS. Note that some .in files need minor editsâ€”just remove the hash (#) symbols in the relevant lines of code.
